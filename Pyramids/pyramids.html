<h5>Pyramids</h5>
<p>The Ancient Egyptian pyramids were built and created as tombs for the pharaohs, kings and queens. The three largest and best well-preserved pyramids are the ones at Giza at the beginning of the Old Kingdom. One of these pyramids were built for the pharaoh named Khufu. It was also known as the "Great Pyramid."</p>

<p>As the building started, the Egyptians used large stones from the quarries nearby. When they put together the first level of the base f the pyramid, they then started building ramps made from mudbrick, limestone chips, and clay. The workers then dragged the heavy stones up the ramps to make the next level of the pyramids. When the pyramid was almost finished, a special block covered in shining metal was placed on the point of the pyramid. Then the outer layer wa covered with blocks of white limestone from the qarries nearby the Nile River. It was trimmed afterwards to make it smooth. By then, the pyramids were finished.</p>

<p>Khufu's pyramid was made for him at Giza. There were many complex parts in it:
	-There were three smaller pyramids for his queens.
    -A mortuary temple was made for Khufu to be worshipped after he died.
