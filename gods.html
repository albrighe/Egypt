<h5>Gods</h5>
<p>There are many gods and goddesses that the Ancient Egyptians believed in. They all have a speciific meaning to their name and a special power. The most common gods and goddesses are Ra, Hathor, Sekhmet, Nut, Geb, Osiris, Seth, Horus, Isis, Thoth, Anubis, Ma'at, Amun, and Bastet.</p>

<p>Ra was a sun god and the king of the gods. He has the shape of a falcon head crowned with a sun disk.</p>

<p>Hathor is the goddess of love, music, and dance. She is a cow with horns and has a sun disk on her head.</p> 

<p>Sekhmet is the goddess of the sun and destruction. She has a lion's face with a woman's body.</p> 

<p>Nut and Geb go together. Nut is the goddess of the sky. She is blue with gold stars. Geb is the Earth god. He is the color of plants and fertile Nile mud. The arch in Nut's body stretches from hprizon to horizon. Geb is the Earth that lies underneath her. These two were separated during the day, but by night, they came togther. This caused darkness.</p> 

<p>Osiris is the god of the dead. He is dressed in white with a crook and flail, and a white crown. He is also the husband of Isis and father of Horus. Osiris is shown as a man with a beard wearing white mummy wrappings. His crown is for the Upper Egypt surrounded with red feathers. His skin is green to represent vegetation.</p> 

<p>Seth is the god of the desert, storm, and violence. He has an animal head with a long curved pointed snout. He is the brother of Osiris. No one seems to know what kind of animal he really is. His description is confusing. Seth carried a sceptre, which had his head on top and his tail on the bottom.</p>

<p>Horus is one of the ost common and famous gods. He is the son of Isis and Osiris. His description is a hawk or a man with a hawk's head with a crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. It makes him look similar to Ra. A famous amulet called the Eye of Horus was healed by Thoth. It would symbolize the moon or the Eye of Ra, or the sun.</p>

<p>Isis is the queen of the Goddesses. She is the wife of Osiris and mother of Horus. She has a throne or sun disk with horns on her head. Her powers was being a great healer and a magician.</p>

<p>Thoth is the god of wisdom, time, writing and the moon. He is the husband of Ma'at. His description is his head that looks like an ibis. Thoth invented hieroglyphics, measurer of Earth, and counter of the stars, and keeper/recorder  of all knowledge. The ibis is a bird rather like a stork, with long legs and a long beak which it uses for prodding in the mud to find small fish. It was a symbol of wisdom and learning because it has a beak shaped like a pen which it dips in the mud, as if it was ink.</p>

<p>Anubis is the god of embalming. He has the head of a jackal. Anubis invented embalming to embalm Osiris, the first mummy. He was the guide of the dead. The Egyptians embalmed their dead, especially their pharaohs, to preserve them, since they thought that this helped them live forever.</p>

<p>Ma'at is the goddess of justice and is the wife of Thoth. She has an ostrich feather in her hair. The feather of Ma'at was an ostrich plume. Ma'at was the goddess of truth, justice and harmony. She was the wife of Thoth, the god of wisdom, since you need wisdom to find truth and justice. Both Ma'at and Thoth helped at the Weighing of the Heart.</p>

<p>Amun is the god of creation. He is crowned with ostrich feathers. Amun was an important god, but there are no stories about him. He created all things. At the same time, he remained apart from creation, totally different from it, and fully independent from it. In fact, he was invisible, so you couldn't have a picture of him! However, if you called him Amun-Re, this allowed people to see him. Then he had a hat with ostrich feathers on, and like all gods with human heads, a beard. Re is another way of spelling Ra, the sun god. Tutankhamun's name contains the name of Amun. It also contains the Ankh, which means Life. His name means "Long life to Amun."</p>

<p>Bastet was the protectress of cats. She was the daughter of Ra. She would either be a cat or have the head of a cat. Bastet was sometimes called bast. She was the goddess of cats. She is a cat, or has the head of a cat, but originally she had the head of a lion. Bastet was the proctress of cats. The Ancient Egyptians had a great respect for cats since they protected the grain from mice and rats. Rats can also cause disease. Killing a cat was punishable by death. When a cat died, the family mourned it, shaving their eyebrows to mark their sadness. Cats were sometimes mummified, like people, and their mummies have been found.</p>
