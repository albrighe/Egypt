<h5>Who we are</h5>
<p>Ancient Egypt is located in Africa. The longest river located in Egypt is called the Nile River. This is where the Egyptians go for essential needs and water resources. The yearly flooding brought enriched soil for good harvests and wealth to the land.</p>

<p>People used mudbrick to make homes in villages throughout the country. They grew their own food and traded foods and goods that they couldn't produce.Most Ancient Egyptians worked as field hands, farmers, craftsmen, and scribes. A small group of people were called nobles. Together, they made the population of Egypt.</p>
